# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is Bool Street Noods. They are a student run noodle company that runs
in Collegetown.

This client meets the client rules as they are a small business that currently operate
with a wix website that is not really used by the company as they mostly function through
social media platforms. They have informed us that they would like a website that relays
information to students and customers and also understand the limitations of this project
in terms of including non-static elements. Furthermore, none of the team members are part
of this organization as we do not work for or with bool street noods.



### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

    We are a noodle company based in collegetown and are open one day a week.
    We make hot oil-seared biang biang noodles that are sold at affordable prices
    to students at Cornell. Our goal is to provide cheap and tasty food to all
    college students.


2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

    All our profits go to a different social cause every week.
    We have donated over 2000 dollars so far to Operation Hope,
    the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and more. Additionally, as
    we are student run we hope to form and leverage a close knit community
    on the Cornell campus.


3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

    We currently operate solely through social media platforms like instagram as
    our website is hosted on wix and is not really usable or updated. We would like
    to build a website so that it reflects our updated information for students to
    access to find out about our company.


4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

    I think the intended audience of our website is the students who buy our noodles
    every week. They are the ones that keep our business running so I would assume
    it is for them!


5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

    I want them to get information about when we are open during the week, when
    they can put orders in, where they should come to pick up their food and
    finally, where our profits are going for the week.

6. What are your goals for this site?

    I think my goal for the website is to make it a tool to propagate bool
    street noods’ mission and also make the information about orders more
    accessible to all our customers.


7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

    Since our company colors are red, yellow and white, I would like the website to
    reflect this. However, we want to stay with a clean feel by keeping the overall
    site modern with media and some inclusion of the company colors.


8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?

    1. [Four Seasons Ithaca](https://www.ithacatogo.com/r/1417/restaurants/delivery/Korean/Four-Seasons-Ithaca)
    2. [Oishii Bowl](https://www.oishiibowl.com/)
    3. [Gangnam Station Ithaca](https://www.gangnamstationithacany.com/)



### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

- Meeting minutes.
- Introductions of the team members and official approval of the project
- Approval of limitations as well as timeline.
- Discussion of client questionnaire as noted above.
- Outlining future meetings to call the client once a week and email mockups of the website.


### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

[Current Client Bool Street Noods Website](https://boolstreetnoods.wixsite.com/website)

![Current Bool Street Noods Website](boolstreetnoods1.png)
![Current Bool Street Noods Website](boolstreetnoods2.png)
![Current Bool Street Noods Website](boolstreetnoods3.png)


The client wants a company informational website where students and customers can go
to find necessary information about the website. This would entail information about
the food the client serves, the days and hours of operation, background about the
founders and the team, and information about the organizations they donate their
profits to along with other special events.


### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal 1: To introduce customers to the company
- Goal 2: To provide customers with information about the dishes they serve
- Goal 3: To provide a background profile about the founders of the company
- Goal 4: To inform students about hours of operation and the pickup location of the orders
- Goal 5: To show customers all the organizations that the proceeds would be going to week by week
- Goal 6: To inform people about Special events and partnerships



### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

Our proposed website is the right “size” for this project as the client is a small
business that currently is only operating through social media platforms and thus
is not a business or organization that will contain a multitude of information that
will make the website beyond the scope of this project. On the flip side, our proposed
website is not too small either as there is just enough information for several pages
of content to be created for the small business and have a lot of content they still
wish to convey to users/customers as they are beginning to establish their online
presence.


## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the sit's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

**Interviewee 5:**

TODO: tell us a bit about your participant

TODO: copy interview questions
TODO: take notes inline with questions


### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: To find out what dishes are being sold

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - TODO: design ideas
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - TODO: rationale

Goal 2: To find out the timings and location

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - TODO: design ideas
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - TODO: rationale

Goal 3: To find out allergens in the dishes

TODO: design ideas and rationale


TODO: add as many goals as needed

Goal 4: To get contact information and payment information


### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.

The site's audience is Cornell students. This audience is cohesive because Bool Street Noods advertises themselves as an affordable food option for Cornell students.

## Website Design Exploration (Milestone 2)

Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <[website url](https://www.oishiibowl.com/)>

    ![Oishii restaurant website in narrow format](oishi-narrow.png)

    ![Oishii restaurant website in wide format](oishi-wide.png)

2. <[website url](https://www.maru-ramen.com/)>

    ![Maru Ramen narrow screen](maruRamennarrow.PNG)

    ![Maru Ramen wide screen](maruRamen.PNG)

3. <[website url](https://www.gangnamstationithacany.com/)>

    ![GangnamStation narrow screen](gangna_narrow.PNG)

    ![GangnamStation wide screen](gangnam_wide.PNG)


### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

In both the narrow and the wide formatting of the Oishii restaurant website, the food options are divided by rice dishes, noodle dishes, salads, appetizers, drinks, desserts, and sauces. In each section, they have the different entries, which include the name of the dish, the ingredients in each respective dish, the price of it, and an image of each of the dishes next to the information. Although each type of offering has their own dedicated section, they are all still contained on one page; clicking the different navigation elements just brings you to a different part of the page.


### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

website reflection/critique:

The main difference between the wide screen and the narrow screen is the navigation bar. In the wide screen, the navigation bar is on the top, with "Order Deivery", "Pickup Order", and "Home" pages being on the left side of the website name "Maru Ramen", and "About Us", "Gallery", "Menu Items", and "Gift Cards" being on the right of the website name. When the screen size changes from wide screen to a narrow screen the navigation bar ecomes a hamburger menu. And when clicked, the hamburger menu opens the navigation bar vertically, taking the whole screen size. Other than the navigation bar, the background image sizes also adjust to be responsibe.


### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

website reflection/critique:

The wide and narrow screens for the GangnamStation do not differ much/ The only slight difference is the navigation bar. The navigation bar for the wide screen is on the right top corner of the screen. For the narrow version of the website, the navigation bar becomes a hamburger menu.


## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

- Background information
- Contact information
- Dish names
- Food prices
- Allergy information for food
- Images of each dish
- Ordering information

### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

justify your content decisions:

Basic information: address, operating hours for people to know when they cnan order and where to pick up their orders.

Dish Names: dish names are going to be in the menu so when the user looks at the menu they know what are the available options to order.

food prices: users usually check the menu prices before they order from the restaurant. Including prices ensures that when the user looks for them they can find them.

allergy information for the food: this piece of content is for people with allergies to ensure that they know what's in the food and to avoid potential health issues.

images of each dish: this is important because if the user doesn't recognize the name of the dish they will be looking for the images to understand whether or not they want to order the food. International students especailly look at the food pictures.

ordering/contact information: ordering and contact information is especially necessary because this restaurant does not have a dine in option and everyone who wants to aet their food has to order it to pick up which means that the ordering and contact information has to be very visible to the user and easily accessible.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

TODO: photos and explanations of each iteration


### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

TODO: tell us which iteration of card sorting you plan to use.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

TODO: why does this organization make sense for your audience (not you)?


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- About
- Menu
- Pick-up
- Charities

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

explain why the pages name make sense to the audience:

Home page is a common practice in web design. The user familiar to the user, hence it makes sense to have the first page with the common information to be named "home".
About page is also intuitive and self-explanatory for the user to excpect what they will be seeing on it, as the "About" page always contains information about the company's history and funders/staff.
Menu page and name make sense because people usually refer to the restaurant's website to find their offerings and prices, and the menu is what is associated with those. People know that they will find all the food offerings and their prices when they click on the "menu" in the navigation bar.
Pick-up page will contain the information about ordering the food and the pick-up information. The users who enter the website with the purpose of ordering a pick-up food would immediately recognize which page to choose fro the navigation bar.
The "Charities" page contains information about the charities that this restaurant donates to. The user, when they see the "charities" page on the navigation bar, would know from the name that the page is about the charities that the restaurant donates to. The fact that the website has a separate page for the charities would mean that they give a huge important to that, and seeing that, users, in this case, university students, might be more interested in ordering from.


## Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.


Theme Idea 1: Minimalistic Design
In this idea for the website theme, we would be utilizing black, white, and red colors for the website since those are some of the colors used in the Bool Street Noods logo. At the same time, this combination of colors wouldn't be too overbearing and would help with the minimalistic look. In addition to the color scheme, the font would be a simple soft and rounded font that doesn't look too bold. Overall this theme is appropriate for the audience because it helps to draw attention to the content that really matters such as the dishes and their prices rather than the aesthetic of the website.

Theme Idea 2: Fast food/ street food
In this idea for the website theme, we would be using the most attracting colors of the fast food industry: yellow, orange, and red. Science suggests that these colors are associatd with food among customers and seeing it the users of the website would automatically associate it with food. Other than that, it would give the currect impression of the restaurant and its mission, which is to be able to provide cheap and accessible food to college students. What else could tell better "cheap and accessible" food other than the street food and everything associated with it.

Theme Idea 3:


The final theme selected for the website is Theme Idea .

## Design (Milestone 2)

Document your site's layout.

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- interactivity idea 1: hamburger menu: this would make the navigation easier on the narrow screens. It is a common practice on the websites that use responsive design for narrow screens and is familiar to the user. This would also save some space on the narrow screen as it shows the contents in a more compact way.
- interactivity idea 2: photo carousel: this would show the photos of food and would allow the user to explore the offered menu.
- interactivity idea 3: drop-down items: making it possible to see the entire menu, with the possiblity of pressing on any specific item to view the recipe and image of it.


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

Layout 1: with this first layout we want to have enough space for the logo, navigation and title. This is consistent even in the narrow screen which even though transforms the dropdown in a "hamburger", still keeps it at the top of the page right next to the logo. Moreover, this sketch aims at showing the efficiency of a carausel interactivity to engage the audience.
![layout1](/design-plan/layout1.jpg)

Layout 2: With this layout we are trying to grasp the audience attention by placing the name of the company over an attractive picture. Above that we have the navigation bar which gives easy access to the user. In the narrow screen, the navigation is also transformed in "hamburger" but in a different location compared to the previous layout.
![layout2](/design-plan/layout2.jpg)

Layout 3: In this last sketch, in the wide screen part we are trying to provide the user with the most essential information regarding our website without the need to even scroll as the text and carousel are one next to the other. The narrow screen also aims at keeping all information as compact as possible by making the navigation innto an "hamburger" and hiding the carousel.
![layout3](/design-plan/layout3.jpg)

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> However, you don't need to provide layout/CSS annotations.
> Please, provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Narrow (Mobile) Design:**

TODO: narrow sketches and explanation


**Wide (Wide) Design:**

TODO: wide sketches and explanation


### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

TODO: 1 paragraph


## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

Hamburger Menu:

Carousel:
The purpose of the proposed interactivity of the photo carousel
is to allow the users to see different food options on the menu easily when they are on the homepage of the website. This allows the users to preview the offered menu on their first glance of the website when deciding whether or not they are interested in the food being offered and it enhances the user experience as they do not need to search deeply in order to find what food is being offered.

Dropdown Menu:

## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the HTML elements, CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.

TODO: interactivity plan


## Client Feedback & Minutes (Milestone 2)
> You should meet with your client again to obtain feedback on your design.
> Provide a summary of the client's feedback and your meeting's minutes.

TODO: client feedback

TODO: meeting minutes


## User Testing (Final Submission)

**Conduct user testing with a minimum of 1 participant for every member of your team.**

### User Testing Tasks (Final Submission)
> Plan out your user testing tasks before doing your user testing.
> These must be actual user testing tasks.
> **Tasks are not questions!**

1. TODO: task 1

2. TODO: task 2

3. TODO: task 3

TODO: add more tasks if necessary (a good rule of thumb is a task for every user goal)


### Participant 1 (Final Submission)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

    TODO: tell us about the participant


2. Does the user belong to your audience of the site?

    > If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the audience?

    TODO: (Yes / No)


### Participant 1 -- Testing Notes (Final Submission)
