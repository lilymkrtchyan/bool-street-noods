# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    We commit to creating a functioning website that appeals to our client and work together in a collaborative and harmonious environment to make this process fruitful and enjoyable for the team members.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    As a team, we have agreed to not interrupt when another person is speaking or speak over them. A team member should wait until another team member has finished speaking to reply to them or communicate the information that they feel is necessary.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    Our first and most frequent method of communication will be through text message. Beyond this, we will have team meetings over phone call or zoom two or three times a week to keep our website on track and be able to update each other on the work we have completed and hold each other accountable.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    According to our client, their preferred mode of communication will be mainly through text message. Additionally, the team will meet with the client periodically, week by week, to update them about our website progress and get necessary feedback so the team can implement changes according to the clients wishes.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    Each member of the team has agreed to be accountable and transparent about their progress and work. The team will reach decisions about work split up and then it is each team member's responsibility to get their work done before the next team meeting. A large emphasis is on transparency. If a team member feels like they are falling behind and will fail to deliver on the work they have been assigned, they should communicate this well in advance with other team members so that they can get help and stay on top of their deadlines.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    If the team disagrees on a certain decision, this will be taken up during a team meeting. In case of a conflict, the conflict will be brought up at the following team meeting and discussed in detail. Upon discussion, a vote will be taken and the majority support decision is taken. This is the approach to conflict that the members of our team agree to uphold.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    If we would like to revisit this contract, the amendment will first be brought up at the team meeting and discussed. In the team meeting, after discussion, a vote will be taken as to whether the amendment should be made. If a majority of the team agrees, the contract will be amended to reflect the new team principles.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    On completion and submission of the final project, the team will go to the dairy bar at Cornell and get ice cream!


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
